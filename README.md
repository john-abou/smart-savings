## Puppeteer Functionality

Puppeteer is used in this application to scrape data for prices from external websites. The websites that are scraped include Amazon, Loblaws, and Walmart. 

The following steps outline how Puppeteer is used in this application:

1. When a user searches for a product, the search term is passed to the server.
2. The server then uses Puppeteer to navigate to the external websites and search for the product.
3. Puppeteer returns the relevant data (product name, image, price, etc.) to the server.
4. The server then sends the data to the client, where it is displayed to the user.
