## Puppeteer Functionality

Puppeteer is used in this application to scrape data for prices from external websites. The websites that are scraped include Amazon, Loblaws, and Walmart. 

The following steps outline how Puppeteer is used in this application:

1. When a user searches for a product, the search term is passed to the server.
2. The server then uses Puppeteer to navigate to the external websites and search for the product.
3. Puppeteer returns the relevant data (product name, image, price, etc.) to the server.
4. The server then sends the data to the client, where it is displayed to the user.

## Installation

To install the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run `npm install` in both the root directory and the client directory
3. To install Puppeteer using the command line, you can use the following command:

This will install the latest version of Puppeteer and its dependencies in your project.

4. Run `npm run develop` to start the application
